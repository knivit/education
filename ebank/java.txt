1. HashMap and TreeMap, usage, differences, algorithms
2. Graphs. Navigation methods, given edges' weighth - how to find out a shortest way.
3. Given a string. Find out is it have the same chars. Not limits for memory usage.
   A complexity must be O(n).

   My answer: Allocate a boolean array [0..65535]. Iterate through the chars and check/set
   appropriate element using char's code as an index.
4. Print all int's between 1 and the given N. Do not use if, while, try .. catch etc.
   No solution in Java.
