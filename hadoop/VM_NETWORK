--- Virtual Box network settings --------

1. The best option is to create 'Bridged Network' - the VM will get a real IP from the router
and will be independent (except shared network card) from the Host.

2. In case strict IP assignment, try next:
- First adapter must be "NAT", all default
- Add a second "Virtual Host Adapter", all default
- Execute
VBoxManage natnetwork add --netname natnet1 --network "192.168.15.0/24" --enable --dhcp on
VBoxManage natnetwork start --netname natnet1

- File -> Settings -> Network: Host Virtual Networks:
  Adapter: IPv4=192.168.56.1; IPv4 Network Mask=255.255.255.0
  DHCP Server: On; Server Address=192.168.56.100; Network Mask=255.255.255.0; 
    Addresses start=192.168.56.101; Addresses End=192.168.56.254
IMPORTANT: 
- When CentOS 6 installing, click "Network" and enable both adapters (click Edit on both)
- After installation, add to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
DHCPCLASS=
IPADDR=192.168.56.101 # 102, 103 etc for other guests
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
BOOTPROTO=static
- check /etc/resolv.conf, it must contain default DNS servers (do not modify it)
- add to /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 c00
- add to Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file
192.168.56.101 c00

These both options DO NOT REQUIRE any port forwarding, as
in case 1), the guest will be using it's own IP;
in case 2), the guest will be using "pseudo" IP.
